<b>TransactiveSCC</b> -- Enabling Transactions in <b>S</b>mart and <b>C</b>onnected <b>C</b>ommunities,

Blockchain-Based Middleware for Decentralization and Coordination of Resource Allocation in Smart Communities


The goal of this project is to enable many distinct stakeholders to coordinate their respective devices which is necessary for large scale distributed systems. Examples of this type of system include smart cities, transactive energy, and IoT. The current form of these systems allows large scale stakeholders to participate, for example in the case of power systems bulk energy markets between power plants and power distribution companies, and in the case of IoT the various internet providers make agreements with each other to allow access to each otherâ€™s networks. However, the complexity of these systems as well as the number of stakeholders that are interested in participating are increasing due to distributed energy resources in the case of power systems and a proliferation of low-cost compute devices in computing systems.


<b>Background</b>

Our work in multi-stakeholder systems has spanned the last 4 years. With the advent of blockchain based technology there was substantial interest in applying to not only financial systems but also enabling contracts between stakeholders. To explore this direction the Smart and Resilient Computing for Physical Environments Lab ([SCOPE Lab](https://scope-lab.org)) has been working to explore these distributed contract based market systems to enable transactive energy as well as the outsourcing of compute tasks to nodes with surplus capacity. We are thankful to [Siemens Corporate Technology](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html)and the National Science Foundation (NSF) for sponsoring our efforts.
